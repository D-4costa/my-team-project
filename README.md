This repository contains the team implementation of the Sleep Outside web application for the WDD 330 course.
The project is developed collaboratively throughout the semester, with each team member contributing individual features, refactors, and improvements following modern frontend development practices.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and modular JavaScript, with Vite as the development and build tool, and follows established linting and formatting standards to ensure consistent, maintainable code.
